                    <h2>The Proposal ୧⍤⃝💐</h2>
                    <p>Hey Lopu 🫂...Do you remember that night? 🌙 It was 4 AM, and I couldn’t sleep because my heart was so full of you ❤️. I asked you the question that I had been carrying inside for so long. I was nervous—my voice barely above a whisper. But when you smiled, it felt like the entire universe paused for a moment, just for us ✨. In that quiet, your answer changed everything.</p>
